\subsection{Useful definitions}

We generalize the term of \emph{$k$-clique community}. In this report, we talk about community without necesarily having the maximality property. Each set of $k$-clique in which there is a path between any $k$-clique to any other, with the definition given in section~\ref{subsec:defcpm}, is called a community. Because in our algorithms communities are build little by little, it allows us to name communities in the algorithm, before they are maximal at the end of the algorithm.

% ...

% $n_k$ denotes the number of $k$-cliques.

% $T_k$ denotes the time to list all $k$-cliques.
