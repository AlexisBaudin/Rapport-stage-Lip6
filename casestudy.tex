\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section we study the results obtained by our algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of k-clique communities and k-clique as a function of k
\item Overlap between the k-clique communities
\item Accuracy compared to the ground truth communities as a function of k.
\end{itemize}
