\begin{abstract}
Automatic detection of relevant groups of nodes in large real-world graphs, 
i.e. community detection, has applications in many fields and has received a 
lot of attention these last twenty years. The most popular method designed to 
find overlapping communities (where a node can belong to several communities)
is perhaps the clique percolation method (CPM). This method formalizes the
notion of community as a maximal union of $k$-cliques that can be reached from 
each other through a series of adjacent $k$-cliques, where two cliques are 
adjacent iff they overlap on $k-1$ nodes. 
Despite much effort CPM has not been scalable to large graphs for medium
values of $k$.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to efficiently list all $k$-cliques 
in very large real-world graphs for medium values of $k$. We build on 
top of this work and significantly scale up CPM. In particular, our algorithm
is several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods and we show 
that we can compute all $8$-clique percolated communities in real-world graphs 
containing billions of edges within an hour of computation on a commodity machine.
Our algorithm needs a single pass over the $k$-cliques, without the need of storing them. 

%\todo{It needs $O(k^2\cdot m)$ memory space where $m$ is the number of edges in the input graph and has a running time in $O(k^2\cdot T_k)$ where $T_k$ is the time to list all $k$-cliques}.
%$m\cdot c^{k-2})$ where $c$ (the core value) measures the sparsity of the input graph.
%We carry a case study shedding lights on the community structures  of real-world graphs and on CPM.



%{\color{red} Let's try to find an exact algo ! If we managed before Noel it is ok, if not, I propose to write a paper about subsequent approximations, discussing in details how problematic graphs look like, and why they should be rare in the nature.

\section{conclusion and discussions}

It works!

However, in some rare cases our approximate Algorithms \ref{algo:ckcom2} and
\ref{algo:ckcom3} merge two different communities into one. 
As we can deduce from real-world experiences,
whose results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:ncoms}, 
it happens only for some rare cases. 
One of such problematic graphs is presented in
Figure~\ref{gr1}. 

{\color{red} VERIFY THIS STATEMENT!}
Algorithms~\ref{algo:ckcom2} and~\ref{algo:ckcom3} 
produce exact results when $k = 3$: because by construction 
they store all $k-1$-cliques, i.e. edges int the case of 
$k=3$.
In order to get around the problematic case illustrated 
on Figure~\ref{gr1}
we could store all triangles. It suggest the creation
of a family of algorithms, the pseudo-code will remain almost
the same, but we replace $E(c_{k-1})$ 
(resp. $E(c_k)$)
by $\mathcal{E}_\ell(c_{k-1})$ (resp. $\mathcal{E}_\ell(c_k)$)
where $\mathcal{E}_\ell(c)$ enumerates all cliques of
size $\ell$ inside a current clique $c$. 
In this regard, our results could be viewed 
as $\ell$-clique relaxation of the original 
clique percolation problem. The quality augments as $\ell$
approaches $k-1$, when $\ell = k-1$ algorithm produces only 
exact results. We could also imagine a sequence of 
passes over the k-cliques considering the difference between 
numbers of detected communities, when this difference is less than $\epsilon$ we say "Ok, it is good enough".

It should be noted, that the order of $k$-clique
processing plays an important yet not fully understood
role in the problematic cases.
It give rise to many interesting
graph theoretical questions about
characterisation of problematic sub-graphs:
how many of them are presented in a typical real-world graph ?
does there exists an order of $k$-clique processing that
completely eliminates all approximation errors ?


{\color{red} 
MAX!!! See, maybe we should turn the paper a way around
and present it as a sequence of approximate algorithms (starting from cpm0) discussing
in more details the sequence of counter-examples and giving some intuitions grown under the light of extensive experiments ? 
Do rare problematic configurations happen
less and less proportionately frequently
when we add more and more value to $\ell$
? 


Doing this we could probably cover
the current lack of serious analysis,
by providing simple formulae based on natural parameters
but extended to $\ell$-clique approximation case.
(A you dare enough to express the complexity using 
parameters that depends on output?)
}

{\color{red} We even could add the last Fantomas example 
from my mail to illustrate how algo CPM0 goes to be bad,
and why cpm1 is better.}

{\color{red}

En fait dans nos communautés il y a des trous...
des zones qui doivent
être interdites
à ajouter les nouveau cliques... 
si jamais on arrive a maintenir
la liste de ces zones de le début ce serait top!
on va gagner ! Car vos expériences montrent que ils sont quand même assez rares.
