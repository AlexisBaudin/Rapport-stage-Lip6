Our contribution is twofold.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We suggest an algorithm to significantly scale up CPM (which has been an extensively studied method) as shown by our extensive experimental evaluation. We also give a detailed theoretical analysis of our algorithm showing that our algorithm has a good running time when the input graph is sparse.
 \item We carry a case study using CPM with unprecedentedly considered sizes of $k$-cliques in large graphs...
\end{enumerate}


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:related}, we present the related work. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} we explain the definitions and notations used throughout the paper. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our algorithms and prove its theoretical guarantees in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. We then evaluate the performance of our algorithm against the state-of-the-art in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}. Finally we carry a case study in Section \ref{sec:casestudy}.
