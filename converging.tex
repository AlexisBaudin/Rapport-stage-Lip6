\subsection{Upper bound algorithm}

In this section, we give an algorithm which gives an upper bound of the number of communities from the $k$-clique percolation. This algorithm takes as a parameter the integer $z$ such as $1 \leq z \leq k-1$. The more $z$ is high and the more the algorithm is precise, but with a cost in time and memory efficiency. For $z=k-1$, the value of the bound is the exact number of $k$-clique communities.

The more we add $k$-cliques to a community, the more we increase the possibility of merging it with other communities. So, this upper bound algorithm is based on not adding all the $k$-cliques to the communities (but enough to have a relevant bound). In consequence, some communities which normally have to be merged, are not, and the bound is higher than the real number of $k$-clique communities.

Let $z$ be fixed in $\{1,...,k-1\}$.

A $z$-community is represented as :
\begin{itemize}
\item "Packs" of $k$-cliques added to the community. A pack is the set of $(k-1)$-cliques of the $k$-cliques added. Two types of packs are possible, we need to work out wich one is better :
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a big clique standing for all its $(k-1)$-sublique
  \item the exhaustive list of all $(k-1)$-subliques
  \end{itemize}

  To simplify, we first work on the exhaustive list of all $(k-1)$-subliques added.

\item List of all $z$-subcliques of the $k$-cliques added to the community 
\end{itemize}
